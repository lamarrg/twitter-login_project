# Twitter Login Project

This is a recreation of project from [Udemy, The Complete Python Postgres Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-python-postgresql-developer-course).

It includes examples of...
* OAuth
* Postgres/Database
* Twitter API
* Flask
* Bootstrap

I still plan in doing a few modifications to make it more my own.

Note: Database logins are for the database on my system, and hidden_constants.py contains access information for my Twitter account, hence the .gitignore file.
